Question: is there any pattern of amount of credit payment? What's the relationship between it and most of the customers? Is there any outlier?

This is a plot about the whole customers and their count of credit payments for the account for all cards. From this visualization, we can see that the amount of most of the customers are clustered from range  0 to 150, which standard for most peoples' credit payments for the account for all cards. There is several outliers from this plot, and the bank can category the account_id of people in outliers to "high risk customer" and provide insight for future customer types.
